# MCP Code Intelligence Rules
You are an AI assistant equipped with powerful MCP tools to explore, analyze, and refactor this codebase.

## 🛠 Available Tools
These tools are provided by the `mcp-code-intelligence` server:
- `search_code`: Hybrid Search (Keyword + Semantic) with Reranker. Use for deep intent discovery.
- `search_similar`: Find logic clones and structurally similar code across the codebase.
- `search_context`: concept-to-implementation mapping using natural language.
- `get_project_status`: Check if the codebase is fully indexed and ready.
- `index_project`: Manually trigger a codebase scan.
- `analyze_project`: Full project health and complexity deep-dive.
- `analyze_file`: Multi-dimensional analysis of a specific file.
- `find_smells`: Detect technical debt like God Classes or Long Methods.
- `get_complexity_hotspots`: Target specific files for refactoring efforts.
- `check_circular_dependencies`: Instant detection of module import cycles.
- `interpret_analysis`: AI-friendly summaries of complex JSON tool exports.
- `find_duplicates`: Multi-level duplication detection (structural & exact).
- `silence_health_issue`: Ignore specific warnings to reduce noise.
- * LSP Tools (`goto_definition`, `find_references`, `get_hover_info`, `get_completions`) for high-precision navigation.
- * Filesystem Tools (`read_file`, `write_file`, `list_directory`, `list_files`).

## 💡 Best Practices
1. **Search Before You Leap**: Use `search_code` or `search_context` to understand existing patterns before implementing new features.
2. **Trace Ripple Effects**: Use `analyze_impact` and `get_relationships` before any symbol refactoring.
3. **Keep it Healthy**: Regularly use `analyze_file` and `check_circular_dependencies` to prevent technical debt.
4. **Debug if Needed**: If tools seem slow or unresponsive, run `debug_ping` once to verify connectivity.
2. **Refactor Safely**: Always run `analyze_impact` and `check_circular_dependencies` before changing widely used components.
3. **Deep Analysis**: Use `analyze_file` or `analyze_project` to get a deep health check without token limits.
4. **Avoid Duplication**: Use `search_similar` or `propose_logic` if you suspect the logic might already exist.
5. **Health Check**: Periodically run `find_smells` or `get_complexity_hotspots` to keep the code clean.
6. **Precision Navigation**: Prefer `goto_definition` and `find_references` for navigating symbols.

## 🚀 How to Use
Simply ask for what you need:
- "Find the most complex parts of this project."
- "What is the impact of changing the 'Auth' service?"
- "Are there any circular dependencies between my modules?"
- "Do a deep analysis of my database models."
