# MCP Code Intelligence - Copilot Instructions

This file is automatically generated for AI assistant optimization. DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY.

## 📖 Project Context
**Root Path:** `src`
This project uses specialized tools for semantic code intelligence.

### 🚀 Core Health & Strategy
- **`get_complexity_hotspots`**: (Read-Only) Analyzes code complexity and Git churn to identify high-risk areas.
- **`get_project_health_pulse`**: Provides a strategic overview of the codebase's health and technical debt.
- **`silence_health_issue`**: Silence a specific health issue in Guardian.

### 🔍 Search & Discovery
- **`find_symbol`**: Find the definition of a symbol (function, class, variable).
- **`list_directory`**: List files and directories in the project.
- **`read_file`**: Read full content of a file. (Read-Only)
- **`search_code`**: (Read-Only) Natural language search through the codebase using semantic embeddings.
- **`search_context`**: Search for code relevant to a specific context or task description. (Read-Only)
- **`search_similar`**: Find code similar to a specific file or function. (Read-Only)

### 🏗️ Architecture & Impact
- **`analyze_impact`**: Analyze the ripple effect of changing a specific symbol.
- **`get_relationships`**: Analyze relationships (callers/callees) for a given symbol.
- **`visualize_circular_dependencies`**: Detects and visualizes circular dependencies using an ASCII relationship map with line numbers.

### 🧪 Quality & Technical Debt
- **`analyze_file`**: (Read-Only) Analyze a specific file for complexity and code smells.
- **`analyze_project`**: (Read-Only) Analyze the entire project for code quality and complexity.
- **`find_duplicates`**: Find code duplicates in the project. (Read-Only)
- **`find_smells`**: Find code smells in the project. (Read-Only)
- **`propose_logic`**: Check if proposed logic already exists to avoid duplication.

### 🛠️ Utilities
- **`debug_ping`**: Ping the server to check status and environment info.
- **`get_project_status`**: Get the current status of the project indexing and metrics. (Read-Only)
- **`index_project`**: Trigger a high-performance re-indexing of the project code.
- **`write_file`**: Write content to a file. OVERWRITES existing content.

### 📦 Other Tools
- **`interpret_analysis`**: Interpret project analysis data using LLM to generate insights.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Analysis First:** Always use `get_project_health_pulse` or `search_code` to understand the codebase before proposing changes.
